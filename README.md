# GPT Subtitler

[GPT Subtitler](https://gptsubtitler.com) is a web application designed to translate subtitles into any language using powerful Large Language Models (LLMs) like OpenAI's GPT, Claude, or Gemini. This serverless application, built with AWS Serverless Stack (SST), provides a seamless, efficient, and scalable solution for subtitle translation.

## Features

- **Multi-Language Support**: Translate subtitles into any language supported by the integrated LLMs.
- **Customizable Settings**: Adjust translation settings such as language, model selection, temperature, prompt customization, and few-shot examples.
- **Batch Processing**: Translate multiple subtitle files at once for increased efficiency.
- **Real-Time Progress Tracking**: Monitor the translation process in real-time.
- **Token-Based Pricing**: Use tokens for translations, eliminating the need for an API key.
- **Stripe Integration**: Secure and seamless payment processing with Stripe.
  
‚ú® Supports high-quality subtitle translation using various models such as Anthropic Claude, GPT-3.5, and GPT-4. Currently, the Claude-Haiku model is recommended.

Additionally, the Gemini-1.5-flash and Gemini-1.5-pro models are available for free users to try, although they may not be as accurate as the Claude-Haiku model.

## Technology Stack

- **Frontend**: React.js
- **Backend**: AWS Lambda, DynamoDB, Cognito, S3
- **Framework**: AWS Serverless Stack (SST)
- **Payments**: Stripe
